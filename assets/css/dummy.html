      During my undergrad, I worked on various projects spanning from aircraft design to machine learning. 
      Few of them are listed below.

            I worked on the development of a Short Range Large Capacity Transport
            airplane demanded by AIAA's 2019-20 RFP. I lead a team of 8 people
            for this purpose and also worked on Optimization, Aerodynamics,
            and Stability analysis of the plane.

            As a part of my Bachelor's thesis, I lead a team of three people, working on the prevention 
            of Loss of Control (LOC). We worked on prevention of LOC in the event of Actuator failures. 
            We implemented a Linear Model Predictive Control System for the same. The algorithm was 
            developed on MATLAB and Simulink. F-18 High Alpha Research vehicle was used as a test 
            platform for demonstration.

            I developed a plugin in Gazebo for simulating the airship dynamics. This work was 
            carried out when I interned at Lighter than Air Systems Laboratory, Indian Insitute of Technology
            Bombay under the guidance of Dr. Rajkumar Pant.<!-- a href="https://www.aero.iitb.ac.in/~rkpant/">Dr. Rajkumar Pant</a>. -->
